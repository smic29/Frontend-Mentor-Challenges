### Github pages link

Since I'm still learning stuff, I can't seem to find how I'm able to view my project's web page without using the link, so I'll have it here for my future reference.

## My Thoughts
### Creating this repository
I wanted to learn how to properly use Markdown and also compile all my repositories into one place. I tried to think ahead because I might have a lot more stuff I'd like to put on Github, and having things organized would be the way to go I believe.

I'm currently learning web development and currently trying to get a firm grasp on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Future me, please remember to always update this readme on every challenge you complete, so we can track our progress.

I really have no idea what to write here, thus I'm just treating it like a journal. For the wife and kids, future me. 

### After uploading repository using git
I wanted my Markdown file to look nice, but I still encounter this issue wherein it just looks like a wall of text, and not like the other one I've seen which looks nicer. I'll try editing and saving this file on github and see if that changes anything. Hopefully it does.

Well it didn't work, but I'll keep trying. Encountered some git issues since I made a repository for the first two challenges and wanted them on this one, so I'm fixing that right now. At least I figured out how to upload the challenge folders properly and I deleted the previous repositories for them (I'm thinking there could have been a better way, but this one works for now so, yeah). Current focus is on how I can make my Readme file look better. It's still showing up as a wall of text for me.

### Repository is looks good now, project time!
I managed to fix the issue with me README.md not properly rendering. Apparently it was caused by the echo command, the one found when you're viewing instructions on how to create a new repository. Anyways, by removing it at the bottom of my README.md, the Markdown file now rendered properly. Good job me!

Now before we move onto future projects, I'll just be quickly fixing up my earlier project's readme files. I probably shouldn't be making a readme file like a journal, but whatever, I'm a beginner, I'll just do things my way until I need to not do that anymore. 

To future me, aim for a one-day project completion!
